This tool allows to create, for one journal, the holdings record in the holdings-database.
Normally the Secs-Web scripts run this process themselves, skipping this shortcut launching-command but using dynamic variables instead of the hard-coded
path-variables (e.g. database to update) from the interaction with the user, defining which library, which journal etc.

For this manual creation of the holdings records to work correctly, the following instructions have to be observed :

1. create a writable folder 'holdingsTemp' in the bases-folder of your Secs-Web database, default (for Linux) : /var/opt/ABCD/bases/secsweb/holdingsTemp
This folder will contain, in the main sub-folder 'hldgCompacted', a series of temporary but necessary database-files in time-stamped sub-folders for each
journal ID processed, and in the main subfolder 'hldgCompacted_logs' a single log-file for each journal ID.

2. check, and if necessary adjust, the paths of the main parameters at the beginning of the script 'shortcut.sh' (or shortcut.bat for Windows), e.g.
THIS_CISIS=/opt/ABCD/www/cgi-bin/ansi/
FACIC=/var/opt/ABCD/bases/secs-web/main/facic
THIS_PATH=/opt/ABCD/www/htdocs/secs-web/hldgModule
THIS_TMP_PATH=/opt/ABCD/www/htdocs/secs-web/hldgModule
HLDG=/var/opt/ABCD/bases/secs-web/main/holdings
TITLE=/var/opt/ABCD/bases/secs-web/title

Obviously these paths need to be matching the real situation and can be adjusted accordingly, but the ones given here in the default application are o.k.
for a default ABCD Linux installation.  Also note that the example paths are for the 'main' database, so change the 'main' part of the path for the name of
the actual database you are working on, e.g. 'fagro'.

3. open a terminal in the directory htdocs/secs-web/hldgModule/lin, which contains the necessary shell-scripts.

4. make all scripts 'executable' with the command : chmod +x *, or if you are not super-user : sudo chmod +x *

5. if you want timing recorded (for management purposes but normally not necessary...), remove the leading '#' in the 2nd line of the script
registerTime.sh. The resulting file 'registerTime.txt' can be used as a log-file but grows fast, so needs cleaning regularly.

6. finally run the script 'shortcut.sh' which starts the whole process, which defines the paths and then runs the other scripts, resulting in an updated
database 'holdings' in your Secs-Web bases-folder.  E.g. the command :
./shortcut 001
will update the holdings-database, creating if not yet there and indexing the record for the journal with ID 001 (in v30 of Title).
So this command has to be repeated for each journal for which you need the holdings summary.
